## Ancient Egypt RAG Q&A System

Ever wanted to chat with the history of Ancient Egypt?

This project makes it possible! 

I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that digs up facts from a curated PDF and serves them to you through an AI historian.

No pyramids were harmed in the making.

##How Does It Work?
In a nutshell: Think of it as an ancient librarian meets AI genie.

1Ô∏è) I cleaned up a huge PDF about Ancient Egypt.

2Ô∏è) Chopped it into chunks with some overlap, so context is never lost in the desert .

3Ô∏è) Turned each chunk into vectors (using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 ‚Äî my embedding hero).

4Ô∏è) Indexed it all using FAISS, so it can find the right chunk faster than you can say ‚ÄúPharaoh‚Äù.

## When you ask a question, the system:

Embeds your question.

Does a similarity search.

Grabs the top-k chunks.

Builds a fancy prompt.

Sends it to GPT-3.5, which writes you an answer ‚Äî all fact-checked by the retrieved context!

## User Interfaces:

Streamlit Web App: Click, ask, get answers!

Command-Line Tool: For the terminal fans.

## How Good Is It?
Accuracy: Over 90% relevant retrieval.

Fast: ~1.7s response time (web), ~1.3s (CLI).

Friendly: Handles on-topic questions like a charm.

No Hallucinations: ‚ÄúWhat are the ingredients of Italian pizza?‚Äù ‚Üí Sorry, off-topic!
